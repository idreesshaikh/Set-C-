# Set-C-
The **Set** container class is similar to the map, except that in sets the key and value are not separated like they are in maps. In other words, in a set the key is simply part of the data and in the case of simple data type like int or char, the key and the value are one and the same. Sets provide very efficient containers when there is no need to separate the key from the data.
